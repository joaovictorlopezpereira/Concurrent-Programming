# Concurrent-Programming
All the code developed during the course **Concurrent Programming**.

Currently, the only implemented code is available in the `src` directory:

- `dot-product`, with a sequential and concurrent implementaton, as well as a separate code to test both implementations;
- `fold.c`;
- `map.c`;
- `sum_conditional_threads.c`, a programming exercise testing barrier synchronization with mutexes and condition variables.
